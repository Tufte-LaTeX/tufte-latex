# The Tufte-LaTeX Classes

Welcome to the beginnings of Tufte-LaTeX package to help you
produce Tufte-style handouts, reports, and notes.

## Installation

If you're using TeX Live on Linux or macOS, you should be able to run
`make install` after cloning the repo. Otherwise, you can copy
`tufte-common.def`, `tufte-book.cls`, and `tufte-handout.cls` to the
appropriate subdirectory of your `TEXMFHOME` directory (probably something
like `$TEXMFHOME/tex/latex/tufte-latex`) and then run `texhash`.

To use the Tufte-LaTeX classes in just one specific LaTeX document, you
can copy `tufte-common.def`, `tufte-book.cls`, and `tufte-handout.cls`
into the working directory of that document.

## Quick Start

You can compile both the sample book and handout with all three TeX
engines (LuaLaTeX, XeLaTeX, and pdfLaTeX) by running `make test`, or you
can compile the book and handout with just one engine by running
`make test-lua`, `make test-xe`, or `make test-pdf`.

If you want to compile just the book or the handout, it's easiest to use
`latexmk` (substituting `xelatex` or `pdflatex` for `lualatex`, if desired):

```shell
$ latexmk -outdir=samples -bibtex -lualatex -jobname=%A-lualatex sample-book.tex
```

or

```shell
$ latexmk -outdir=samples -bibtex -lualatex -jobname=%A-lualatex sample-handout.tex
```

You could also do things manually. For the sample handout, run:

```shell
$ lualatex sample-handout
$ biber sample-handout
$ lualatex sample-handout
$ lualatex sample-handout
```

The result should look like the sample handout PDFs in [`samples/`](samples/).

The sample book can be compiled with the following:

```shell
$ lualatex sample-book
$ biber sample-book
$ makeindex sample-book.idx
$ lualatex sample-book
$ lualatex sample-book
$ lualatex sample-book
```

As when using `latexmk`, you can substitute `xelatex` or, less preferably,
`pdflatex` for `lualatex` above.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors of the form,

    ! LaTeX Error: File `paralist.sty' not found.

you will need to obtain missing packages from [CTAN](http://ctan.org).
For package installation instructions and answers to many other
questions, see the [UK TeX FAQ](http://www.tex.ac.uk/faq/) or search the [`comp.text.tex` group](http://groups.google.com/group/comp.text.tex).

The following packages are required:

 * chngpage or changepage
 * fancyhdr
 * fontenc
 * geometry
 * hyperref
 * biblatex and biber
 * optparams
 * paralist
 * placeins
 * ragged2e
 * setspace
 * textcase
 * textcomp
 * titlesec
 * titletoc
 * xcolor
 * xifthen

The following packages are optional and will be automatically used if installed:

 * beramono
 * fontspec
 * helvet
 * iftex
 * letterspace (in the microtype package)
 * mathpazo
 * soul
